            Hi, I’m Udit — a Computer Science student at JECRC University and an aspiring Software Developer. <br>
            I enjoy turning ideas into fast, reliable, and user-focused applications. My main stack includes React, <br>
            Next.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, and I’m comfortable building across the full stack—from designing <br>
            APIs to fine-tuning frontend performance. I thrive in fast-paced environments like hackathons, <br>
            where quick problem-solving and clean execution matter most. I'm always exploring better ways to <br>
            to build scalable systems, write maintainable code, and deliver products that actually make an impact. <br>
            I’m currently looking to contribute to teams where I can learn deeply, ship often, and grow as an engineer.
